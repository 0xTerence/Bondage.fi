### paperhandsprotection ðŸ”’ 

removing the ability to fumble a bag

~forced left curvature~

users deposit erc20 tokens in VeMe to receive veTokens

all tokens are locked for a period of 12h from time of deposit in VeMe, within those 12 hours, veToken holders vote to extend or reduce timelock
> timelock voting affects all veTokens, beginning immediately after the conclusion of h12
> voting cycles operate on 4 hour rolling window, 3 cycles per initial 12h

### roadmap 
launch VeMe

implement oracle based unlocks (ie all VeTokens unlock at 5x)

implement take profit (5x, 10x, 100x)

distribute VEME

introduce pool based timelocks

introduce pool voting with VEME
